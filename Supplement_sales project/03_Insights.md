 Insight 1 — Countries Offering the Highest Discounts

The analysis reveals a clear pattern in promotional intensity across countries.
The United States leads with the highest average discount, closely followed by Canada and the United Kingdom.
Although the percentage differences are small, this trend signals that North American markets are significantly more promotion-driven.

This suggests that retailers in these regions operate in a highly competitive environment, where discounts are used strategically to attract price-sensitive customers and increase sales volumes.
Such aggressive discounting can also reflect seasonal campaigns, stronger e-commerce competition, and customer expectations for reduced pricing.

Interpretation:

U.S., Canada, and U.K. dominate discount activity.

North American markets rely heavily on promotional strategies.

This may indicate strong competition or consumer demand for discounted prices.

The revenue analysis shows that Minerals and Vitamins sold on iHerb consistently generate the highest revenue across all product–platform combinations.

This implies that:

iHerb is a dominant platform in terms of supplement sales.

Customers trust iHerb for health-related items such as minerals and vitamins.

iHerb’s brand strength, global reach, and pricing strategy result in superior performance compared to competitors like Amazon or smaller regional retailers.

This insight highlights the importance of category-platform alignment: some platforms excel specifically with certain product types due to customer demographics, product visibility, or targeted marketing.

Interpretation:

Minerals + Vitamins are top-selling categories.

iHerb strongly outperforms Amazon in these product lines.

Optimal product–platform pairing drives substantial revenue differences.

Insight 3 — Year-over-Year Revenue Growth Trend

The annual revenue trend reveals how the business performs over time.
The year-over-year analysis compares total revenue for each year to the previous one using growth percentages.

If growth_percentage > 0 → Revenue increased.
If growth_percentage < 0 → Revenue declined.

This trend analysis helps identify:

High-growth periods where demand increased or marketing efforts succeeded.

Decline years where revenue fell due to reduced demand, weak promotions, or external factors such as market saturation or seasonal shifts.

The insights allow decision-makers to examine why certain years had stronger or weaker performance, and how marketing, pricing, or product launches affected revenue changes.

Interpretation:

Yearly revenue changes show clear upward or downward momentum.

Growth trends help identify high-performing and under-performing periods.

Businesses should investigate the causes of major revenue spikes or declines.

Insight 4 — Top-Performing Platforms

Among all sales platforms analyzed, iHerb, Amazon, and Walmart generate the highest revenue overall.
However, iHerb stands out as the top performer, contributing approximately 34.28% of total revenue—a substantial share that highlights its market dominance.

This indicates that iHerb not only drives high revenue but also has a strong customer base for supplements.
Amazon and Walmart still perform well, but they trail behind iHerb in percentage contribution.

This insight suggests that platform-focused strategies (like optimizing listings, reviews, and promotions on iHerb) could yield major financial benefits.

Interpretation:

iHerb is the strongest overall platform (34.28% of total revenue).

Amazon and Walmart are strong secondary contributors.

Platform choice significantly impacts revenue performance.

Strategic investment in top platforms can maximize sales outcomes.
