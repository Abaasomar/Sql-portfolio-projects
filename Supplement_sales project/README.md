This project focuses on cleaning and preparing a Supplement Sales dataset for analysis using SQL.
The dataset initially contained issues such as:

Incorrect date formats

Missing values represented as zeros

Inconsistent data structure

Columns using wrong data types

The primary goal of this project is to ensure the dataset is fully cleaned, consistent, and ready for EDA (Exploratory Data Analysis), reporting, and dashboard development.

🧠 Key Objectives

Convert invalid date strings into MySQL DATE format

Impute missing values (units returned & discount) using category-level averages

Create a backup working table to preserve original data

Standardize data types for accuracy

Prepare dataset for analysis and visualization
