--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

This project analyzes Somalia’s government financial data (2015–2022) to reveal spending patterns, ministry priorities, top expense categories, and funding for international projects. The goal is to generate insights and actionable recommendations for better financial management.

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Business Questions

1. What is the average annual spending?  
2. Which ministry spends the most each year?  
3. Which expense categories have the highest spending?  
4. How much is allocated to internationally funded projects?

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Repository Structure

## Repository Structure

The project is organized as follows:

- [`01_basic_eda.sql`](01_basic_eda.sql) – Basic EDA: row counts, duplicates, missing values, summary statistics
- [`02_sql-analysis.sql`](02_Sql-analysis.sql) – SQL queries for all financial questions
- [`03_insights.md`](03_Insights.md) – Insights with root causes
- [`04_recommendations.md`](04_Recommendations.md) – Recommendations based on insights
- [`README.md`](README.md) – Project overview and summary



--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

## Analysis Approach

- Conducted **EDA**: row counts, missing values, duplicates, and summary stats.  
- Wrote **SQL queries** to answer each business question.
