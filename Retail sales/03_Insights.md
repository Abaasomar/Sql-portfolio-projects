## 🔎 Insight 1.1:TOP 5 AGE/GENDER GROUPS BY SPENDING

The analysis shows that certain age and gender groups demonstrate significantly higher average spending behavior compared to others.

Male customers in their early 30s exhibit the highest spending intensity per transaction, indicating the presence of high-value but potentially low-frequency buyers.

Female customers in their mid-30s contribute strongly to overall revenue, combining consistent purchasing behavior with relatively high spending levels.

Customers between their mid-30s and mid-40s consistently appear among the top-spending demographic segments, suggesting that this age range represents a core revenue-driving group.

Younger customers, while active, generally show lower spending intensity compared to middle-aged segments.

Overall, spending power appears to increase with age up to the mid-40s before stabilizing.

## 🔎 Insight 02: Sales Patterns Over Time

The analysis of monthly sales trends reveals clear fluctuations in revenue, transaction volume, and items sold throughout the year.

Sales activity varies month to month, highlighting periods of higher and lower consumer engagement. Early-year months show moderate sales, followed by growth in mid-year, indicating possible seasonal demand or promotional effects.

Transaction volume and total items sold generally move in parallel with revenue trends, suggesting that increases in sales are primarily driven by higher purchase activity rather than significant changes in pricing or product mix.

Overall, the dataset demonstrates cyclical sales behavior across months, emphasizing the importance of tracking sales trends over time to inform inventory management, marketing strategies, and resource allocation.

## 🔎 Insight 03.1: Overall Performance of Product Categories

The analysis of product categories reveals clear differences in revenue generation, sales volume, and transaction frequency across categories.

Electronics, Clothing, and Beauty consistently appear as the top-performing categories, indicating strong customer demand and contribution to overall revenue.

While Electronics leads in total revenue, Clothing and Beauty show high transaction counts, suggesting frequent purchases even if the average transaction value is slightly lower.

This demonstrates that the retail business relies on a combination of high-value items (Electronics) and high-frequency categories (Clothing and Beauty) to drive overall sales performance.

Overall, understanding category performance helps prioritize inventory management, marketing focus, and promotional strategies for the most impactful product lines.

## 🔎 Insight 03.2: Spending by Age and Product Category

The analysis of spending across age groups and product categories highlights distinct preferences among different demographic segments.

Younger customers, such as those around 18 years old, tend to spend more frequently on categories like Beauty and Clothing, indicating strong interest in personal care and fashion items at an early age.

Middle-aged customers, for example those aged 19–36, demonstrate higher spending in Electronics, suggesting that technology and high-value items appeal more to slightly older demographics.

Across all age groups, there is a clear pattern where some categories drive frequent smaller transactions (e.g., Beauty and Clothing), while others, like Electronics, contribute higher-value purchases with fewer transactions.

This insight emphasizes the importance of tailoring marketing, promotions, and product assortment strategies according to age-specific preferences for each product category.
