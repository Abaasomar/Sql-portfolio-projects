🛒 E-commerce Transactions Analysis

This project analyzes e-commerce transactions data to uncover insights about revenue performance, discount strategies, product categories, sales trends, and customer payment behavior.
The analysis is performed using MySQL / SQL Workbench.

Project Overview

The main goals of this project are:

Clean and prepare the e-commerce transactions dataset for analysis.

Understand which products and categories generate the highest revenue.

Evaluate discount strategies and promotional effectiveness.

Analyze sales performance over time.

Identify the most used payment methods and high-value transactions.

Provide actionable insights to optimize sales, marketing, and inventory management.

By analyzing these patterns, actionable recommendations can be made to improve revenue, customer engagement, and operational efficiency.

Data Cleaning Steps

The first phase focused on preparing a clean dataset for accurate analysis:

Handling Missing Discounts: Replaced missing discount values (discount = 0) with valid discounts from the same product category.

Standardizing Purchase Dates: Converted purchase_date from mixed text formats (DD/MM/YYYY and DD-MM-YYYY) to MySQL DATE format (YYYY-MM-DD).

Validating Logical Values: Checked for negative price or final_price, ensured final_price ≤ price, and verified discounts were within 0–100%.

Duplicate Checks: Verified that users did not have duplicate purchases of the same product on the same day.

After these steps, the dataset was clean, consistent, and ready for exploratory data analysis.
